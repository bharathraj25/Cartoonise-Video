# Cartoonise-Video
Project to cartoonise any video with Image processing and Machine Learning</br>
<h3>Approaches :</h3>
<h4>Using the K-Means Clustering Algorithm from Machine Learning</h4></br>
The Cartoonise_Kmeans.py file contains the code for this implementation. In this approach the iamge is flattened to an array then
it is put to the kmeans algorithm from which centres are found and finally these centres are used to segregate the different color 
regions in the image. This technique is basically used for Colour reduction in image processing .</br>
<h5>System Requirements: Python 3 , OpenCV, Numpy installed.</br>

<h3>How to use this project</h3>
1.Keep thepc wherever you want to cartoonise.</br>
2.Run the python scripts given above acoording to preference.</br>
3.Enjoy the effect.</br>
